# repl #

## A mass search/replace tool ##

**repl** performs 'gather/scatter' editing. In 'search mode' it collects lines that you wish to change in multiple files into a single 'edit-file'. You then make the changes to the lines in the edit-file and then use the tool in 'replace mode' to apply the edits to all of the source files in one go. You can change, delete, insert or append lines as necessary. For full details see the built-in help (accessible with the '--help' option). 

**repl** was inspired by a pair of programs, **rep** and **rpl** that I first encounted in the 1980's and written, I believe, by someone at IST (Imperial Software Technology). It may be an old concept, but it's still useful!

I wrote the first version of this script more than 10 years ago. I've made some improvements over the years, but if I was writing it today it would be rather different stylistically!
